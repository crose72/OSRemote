Apps for Operation Squirrel development and deployment.

Will update this later.  The most important thing for you to know right now is that this works and you can just build it on codemagic right now and then install it on your phone!  Enjoy :)  

P.S. You could also just open this flutter project in VSCode and compile it there while connected to your phone, that works too.  I only have an android phone, and no mac computer so I couldn't compile a full iOS binary, so if you're an iphone user you'll have to do that part, but it builds for android and ios successfully and is ready to install on android out of the box.
